# 🚁 **Autonomous Drone Delivery Project** 🚁

Welcome to the **Autonomous Drone Delivery Project**! This is a fun, hobbyist project where we’re building a custom autonomous drone to deliver packages! 😎

---

## 🛠️ **Project Overview**

Our goal is to create a **fully autonomous drone** capable of flying and delivering packages without any human intervention. 🚁

### **Main Objectives**:
- **Autonomous Navigation**: The drone will navigate to delivery points on its own, using GPS and sensors. 📍
- **Obstacle Avoidance**: The drone will detect and avoid obstacles in its flight path to ensure safe delivery. 🔍
- **Custom Drone Build**: This project uses a custom-built drone with specialized hardware and software to achieve the goal. ⚙️
